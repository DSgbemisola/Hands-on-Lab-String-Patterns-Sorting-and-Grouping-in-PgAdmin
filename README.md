# Hands-on Exercises on Built-in functions - Aggregate, Scalar, String, Date and Time Functions in PostgreSQL

In this hands-on exercises, I demonstrated skills in writing SQL statements using Built-in functions - Aggregate, Scalar, String, Date and Time Functions in PostgreSQL

PgAdmin 4 (PostgreSQL 15)

# Database Used in this Lab

The dataset used in this hands-on exercises is called PETRESCUE and is gotten from IBM.

# Objectives

The objectives of the hands-on excercises are to:

1. Compose and run sub-queries with multiple tables
2. Check query results and view log files

# Task 1: Creating a new database and the PetRescue table

Rather than create the table manually by typing the DDL commands in the Query editor of my PgAdmin, I downloaded and executed the script containing the create table command.

The script file is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AVg-41q_HH0koUU-30hmEAYtDFEWVwUe/view?usp=sharing





# Task 2: Aggregate Functions
